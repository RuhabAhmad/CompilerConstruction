## Test File 5: Comments Testing
## This file tests single-line and multi-line comments

## Single-line comment at the start
start

    ## Variable declarations with comments
    declare Counter;  ## This is an inline comment
    declare Sum;      ## Another inline comment
    declare Product;
    
    ## Initialize variables
    Counter = 0;
    Sum = 0;
    Product = 1;
    
    #* This is a multi-line comment
       that spans multiple lines
       and should be completely ignored
       by the scanner *#
    
    ## Loop with comments inside
    loop Counter < 10
        Sum += Counter;     ## Add to sum
        Product *= Counter; ## Multiply product
        Counter++;          ## Increment counter
        
        #* Nested comment in loop
           This should also be ignored *#
        
        output Sum;
        output Product;
    
    ## Function with extensive comments
    #* 
       Function: Calculate_factorial
       Purpose: Calculate factorial of a number
       Parameters: N - the number
       Returns: Factorial of N
    *#
    function Calculate_factorial(N)
        declare Result;
        declare I;
        
        Result = 1;  ## Initialize result
        I = 1;       ## Initialize counter
        
        ## Main calculation loop
        loop I <= N
            Result *= I;  ## Multiply result by current number
            I++;          ## Move to next number
        
        ## Return the final result
        return Result;
    
    ## Multiple single-line comments in sequence
    ## Comment line 1
    ## Comment line 2
    ## Comment line 3
    ## Comment line 4
    
    declare Test1;
    declare Test2;
    
    ## Comment before assignment
    Test1 = 100;
    Test2 = 200;  ## Comment after assignment
    
    #* Multi-line comment with special characters
       !@#$%^&*()_+-={}[]|:;"'<>,.?/
       These should all be ignored
    *#
    
    ## Testing comment with operators
    declare X;
    declare Y;
    X = 10; ## X = 5 + 5
    Y = 20; ## Y = 10 * 2
    
    #* Comment with code-like content
       declare Fake_var;
       Fake_var = 999;
       This should not be executed
    *#
    
    ## Condition with comments
    condition X < Y  ## Compare X and Y
        output "X is less than Y";  ## Output message
    else
        output "X is not less than Y";
    
    #*
    Multi-line comment
    with varying indentation
        and different spacing
            should still work fine
    *#
    
    ## Multiple multi-line comments
    #* First multi-line comment *#
    #* Second multi-line comment *#
    #* Third multi-line comment *#
    
    declare Final_var;
    Final_var = 42;
    
    #* Comment with nested asterisks
       Some text * with * asterisks
       More text ** double asterisks
       Still inside comment
    *#
    
    ## Edge case: Comment-like patterns in strings
    declare Comment_string;
    Comment_string = "This is not a ## comment";
    output Comment_string;
    
    declare Multi_comment_string;
    Multi_comment_string = "This is not a #* comment *# either";
    output Multi_comment_string;
    
    ## Comment at the very end of a line with code ##
    output Final_var;  ##
    
finish  ## End of program

## Final comment after finish
#* Final multi-line comment
   End of test file *#
